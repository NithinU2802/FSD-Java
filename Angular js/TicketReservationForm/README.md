# Angular Implementation in Traditional Method of Scripting...!



# Purpose and Functionality:

AngularJS -> The script tag for AngularJS is used to include the AngularJS library in your HTML
file. AngularJS is a JavaScript framework for building dynamic web applications with features 
like two-way data binding, dependency injection, and modular architecture.

Angular CLI -> The npm install -g @angular/cli command is used to install the Angular CLI globally
on your system. Angular CLI is a command-line interface tool that provides a set of commands for
creating, managing, and building Angular applications. It simplifies tasks like generating components,
services, and modules, as well as building, testing, and serving Angular applications.



# Version and Development Status:

AngularJS -> The script tag you provided imports AngularJS version 1.6.9. AngularJS is an older version
of the Angular framework and is considered stable. It has been widely used but is no longer actively 
developed or maintained by the Angular team.

Angular CLI -> The npm install -g @angular/cli command installs the Angular CLI, which is specifically 
designed for Angular version 2 and above. Angular, the successor to AngularJS, is a complete rewrite of
the framework with significant changes and improvements. Angular is actively developed and maintained by 
the Angular team.

# Workflow and Project Structure:
AngularJS ->  With AngularJS, you can build applications using script tags directly within HTML files. It 
follows a more traditional approach where you write JavaScript and HTML code together in a single file.
Angular CLI -> Angular CLI promotes a modular and component-based architecture for building Angular applications.
It encourages the separation of concerns and provides a command-line interface for generating components, 
services, and other Angular features. Angular CLI also sets up a standardized project structure, making it 
easier to organize and scale Angular applications.
