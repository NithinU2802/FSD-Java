# CSS Background Image 

     The CSS background image property is used to set the background in a webpage. The background is defined in 
the body elements....!

            Syntax: Background-image: url("image-path");

    Properties: 
        There are several different types of background properties in CSS. which are 
                    -> Background-image
                    -> Background-repeat
                    -> Background-position

    *As a default if the image size is more small then the background repeation is automatically turn on hence 
in above code I implemented "Background-repeat: no-repeat;".
